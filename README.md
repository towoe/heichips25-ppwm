# HeiChips 2025 Programmable PWM

## Overview

This project aims to create a programmable PWM module.
In this context, "programmable" signifies that the module is initialized with a set of instructions.
These instructions are then executed by its internal state machine, enabling dynamic PWM behavior.
This allows for modifications to the PWM characteristics over time.
A practical application of this would be, for instance, creating a pulsing LED effect.
