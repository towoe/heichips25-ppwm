# HeiChips 2025 Hackathon Template

This repository is the submission template for the HeiChips 2025 Hackathon.

Please implement your group project based on this template and notify us once you are done, so we can integrate your macro into the chip for tapeout. See [Submission](#Submission).

Your project will be connected to a small eFPGA along with all other user projects. This allows you to configure the eFPGA to route the I/Os of your project to the chip I/Os, implement additional logic in the eFPGA, connect several user projects together (ask what other teams are working on!), and make use of the SRAM.
For more information, see the HeiChips 2025 Tapeout repository: https://github.com/FPGA-Research/heichips25-tapeout

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must rename the top-level of your design to make it unique. It must start with `heichips25_`, for example `heichips25_best_project_4ever`.
> Make sure to update the top-level name throughout the repository.

In order to ensure smooth integration of your macro into the chip, we provide two different DEF templates which specify the geometry of your macro and the pin positions.
The smaller DEF template is used by default and is 500um x 200um in size, the larger DEF template is 500um x 415um in size. If you would like to use the second template, please talk to us, as there are limited slots available for it.

> [!TIP]
> If you only need a tiny fraction of the small DEF template, please coordinate and merge with another team to make the best possible use of the area.

All submitted designs will be included on the chip (given the space), however, one team will be selected for the **HeiChips 2025 Award** based on several factors. The exact criteria will be announced before the Hackathon.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> The HeiChips VM has Nix already pre-installed.

If you haven't installed Nix yet, please do so using LibreLane's documentation: [Nix-based Installation](https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/common/nix_installation/index.html). 

Now you simply need to execute `nix-shell` at the root directory of this repository to enable all of the required tools. This has to be done each time you open a new shell.

The following tools are included:

- LibreLane and its dependencies
- cocotb with Icarus Verilog and Verilator (WIP)
- GTKWave and Surfer (WIP)
- nextpnr (icestorm, trellis) and openFPGALoader

These tools enable you to implement your macro for the chip, run simulation using cocotb, and emulate your design on an FPGA.

## Simulation and Verification

To verify your design implement a testbench with [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) and, as the underlying simulator, Icarus Verilog or Verilator.

To run the simulation testbench simply execute:

```
make sim
```

Or for gate-level simulation:

```
make sim-gl
```

By default Icarus Verilog is used as simulator. To use Verilator, simply set `export SIM=verilator` and run the testbench again.

The waveforms are stored under `tb/sim_build/*.fst`.

You can view the waveforms using, e.g., GTKWave:

```
gtkwave tb/sim_build/heichips25_template.fst
```

Make sure to update the testbench for your design.

## Emulation on FPGA

The following FPGA boards are supported by the Makefile:

- [iCEBreaker](https://icebreaker-fpga.org/)
- [ULX3S](https://radiona.org/ulx3s/)
- [iCE40HX8K-EVB](https://www.olimex.com/Products/FPGA/iCE40/iCE40HX8K-EVB/)
- [Basys 3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to edit the top-level module under `fpga/<board_name>/<board_name>_top.sv` for your FPGA board so that it is compatible with your HeiChips design.

The make targets for iCE40HX8K are:

```
make synth-ice40hx8k
make pnr-ice40hx8k
make upload-ice40hx8k
```

The make targets for iCEBreaker are:

```
make synth-icebreaker
make pnr-icebreaker
make upload-icebreaker
```

The make targets for ULX3S are:

```
make synth-ulx3s
make pnr-ulx3s
make upload-ulx3s
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Support for Basys 3 (Artix7) is not yet upstreamed in nextpnr. Thus we make use of the excellent [openXC7](https://github.com/openxc7) project, which provides a fork of nextpnr called `nextpnr-xilinx`.
> However, this also means that the setup is slightly different. Instead of invoking `nix-shell` at the root of this repository, you need to invoke `nix-shell` inside of `nix-opencx7/`.

The make targets for Basys 3 are:

```
make synth-basys3
make pnr-basys3
make upload-basys3
```


## Physical Implementation using LibreLane

To implement the macro of your project, run the following make target, which invokes LibreLane:

```
make macro
```

To view the macro in the OpenROAD GUI:

```
make macro-openroad
```

To view the layout of the macro with KLayout:

```
make macro-klayout
```

## Submission

In order to submit your design for integration into the HeiChips 2025 Tapeout, please open an issue at the following repository: https://github.com/FPGA-Research/heichips25-tapeout/issues

**The submission deadline is August 17, anywhere on earth.**

The issue should contain the following information:

- The name of your group
- The name of your project
- The group members
- The link to your repository

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Your template repository needs to contain the final macro in the `macro/` folder.

Checklist:

- [ ] The project top-level has a unique name starting with `heichips25_`.
- [ ] The design is verified and tested.
- [ ] The macro is stored under `macro/`.
- [ ] `TopMetal2` in the macro is empty (for integration).
- [ ] The macro is DRC clean (minimal DRC set without fill checks).
- [ ] The macro uses the default power pins (VPWR, VGND).
- [ ] The project is licensed under Apache 2.0.
